==Overview
This system brings together the transportation data I will use to demonstrate the code:

* UTA routes
* UTA stations/stops
* UTA rates
* UTA news

There should be more, this is a good start.

The data goes first into the transactional models.  Other ETL also needs to convert from transactional to:

* dimensional
* semantic

==ISSUES

I'm having a hard time getting the data out of the system.  I'm using scrubyt, which is a bit of a learning curve.  It's an interesting approach, but it doesn't have a whole lot of traction.  In the years that it's been around, there hasn't been a whole lot written about it.

I found scrapi which is a simpler approach:

require 'rubygems'
require 'scrapi'

scraper = Scraper.define do
	process "title", :page_name => :text
	result :page_name
end

uri = URI.parse('')

p scraper.scrape(uri)

There is more on scrapi here: http://railscasts.com/episodes/173-screen-scraping-with-scrapi

I also found Firequark, which gives me good CSS Selectors.
